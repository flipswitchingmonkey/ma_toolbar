# ma_toolbar
A very simple After Effects toolbar.

Just a little customizable toolbar to run your own scripts or any AE function or expression from.

Disclaimer: this is a script made for internal use as more of a proof of concept. So there is very little going on in terms of security or error checking (just the basics). If you plan to use it in a larger setting, be aware that evaluating any old Javascript that you read from some XML file WILL eventually bite you in the ass. Consider yourself warned. That said, if it helps you in any way, that's fine.
